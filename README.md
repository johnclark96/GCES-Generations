Welcome to Gotta Catch 'Em Small (GCES)!

This is a progression based restriction plugin requested by Willobe that modifies the player's ability to catch, evolve (coming soon I hope), and level up Pokemon based on tiers and permission nodes.

You can restrict the player's ability to catch Pokemon based on level tiers, as well as restrict them being able to catch legendary Pokemon without the specified permission.

The progression system works in tiers which are defined in the config. The default setting in the config has a tier that allows players to catch Pokemon between levels 1 and 20.

You can also restrict the player's ability to level up their Pokemon to a certain level based on tiers that work off permission nodes as well.

The default tier value in the config stops players from leveling up their Pokemon past level 20.


```
Commands and permissions:
    /gces setlvl <category> <player> <level>
    /gces levelup <category> <player>
        gces.command.admin
        
    /gces list
        gces.command.list
        
        
Dependencies:
    HuskyUI (like with almost all my plugins)
    LuckPerms (also like with almost all my plugins)    
    Pixelmon Generations (also like with almost, if not all, of my plugins)
```
